# Project mission and Summary: 

Helping researchers work open with confidence in their digital safety!

Digital safety and privacy threats can create a chilling effect on open research, academic freedom, and those who work open (especially when research is deemed controversial). There are currently few formal resources to learn more about the issues and best practices for assessing and addressing potential threats to digital safety and privacy in the academic realm.

This project will produce an Open Educational Resource (OER) for members of the higher ed community looking to work or teach open.  We invite collaborators to contribute expertise and stories to our OER.  This book can be used in full or in part and may be used both inside and outside the classroom.
